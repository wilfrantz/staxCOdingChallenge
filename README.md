# Doubly Linked List Implementation in C++

This is a simple C++ program that implements a doubly linked list data structure. The program allows for the manipulation of the linked list by providing functionalities to add and remove nodes.

## Features

- Doubly linked list: Allows movement forward and backward in the list.
- Add and remove nodes: Supports adding nodes at the beginning of the list, as well as removing nodes from the list.
- Each node contains a reference to application data.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build and run the program using a C++ compiler.
3. Explore the provided functionalities to add and remove nodes from the linked list.

## Unit Tests

The program includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionalities. The unit tests cover various scenarios for adding and removing nodes, as well as other operations on the linked list.
